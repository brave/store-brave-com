Any claims for misprinted, damaged, or defective items must be submitted within 30 days of receipt of the product. For packages lost in transit, all claims must be submitted no later than 30 days after the estimated delivery date. Claims deemed an error on our part are covered at our expense.

If you notice an issue with the product[s] you ordered or anything else on the order, please email <a class="link" href="mailto:merch@brave.com">merch@brave.com</a>. In your email, please explain the issue in detail and upload relevant photos where possible. We can then send you information about how to return or exchange your order.

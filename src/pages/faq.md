## How long will it take to receive my order?

In general, it takes 2-5 business days for an order to be processed and shipped. But note that shipping times can vary widely, depending on the location and the items ordered. Every item is made-to-order, so receiving your particular item may take slightly longer than expected. See the following FAQs for more info.

## Where is the tracking number for my order?

For now, we don't send tracking information or status updates for orders. You will receive a receipt, but no update emails. We hope to implement tracking and status updates in a future iteration of the Brave Merch Store.

If you've waited longer than three weeks for your order, you can email merch@brave.com for an update.

## What parts of the world (and what countries) do you ship to?

We ship worldwide, with a few exceptions. These exceptions include countries we can't ship to because of legal restrictions or shipping carrier limitations with our fulfillment company. If we have difficulty shipping your order, customer support will contact you.

Currently, the countries we cannot ship to include:

Belarus, Ecuador, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria

Currently, certain items are limited for the following destinations:

Afghanistan, Bhutan, Brunei, Chad, Laos, Libya, Mongolia, Samoa, South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Yemen

## Will I receive my order all at once?

It depends. Often you'll receive your whole order at once. But some items may take longer to produce than others, or be produced at different locations. In these cases your order may be split into multiple shipments.

## Can I exchange or return my purchase?

Please see the [Refunds & Returns](https://store.brave.com/refunds-and-returns/) page for more info on our policy for returns, refunds, and exchanges.

## Where are my orders shipped from?Â 

We use a fulfillment company that has production facilities located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Spain, and Latvia. The item you order will be shipped from the closest available facility to you. Sometimes different items in your order will be shipped from different locations depending on availability.
